        <h1>About StudyFlow</h1>
        <p>
            StudyFlow was created as a capstone project to address a common problem faced by students: the lack of a simple, clean, and intuitive tool to organize their studies. In a world full of complex and feature-heavy applications, StudyFlow aims to provide a lightweight and straightforward solution.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to help students reduce stress and improve their productivity by providing a visually clean and highly interactive platform for managing their academic tasks. We believe that a well-organized plan is the first step towards achieving academic success.
        </p>

        <h2>Technology Used</h2>
        <p>
            This entire application is built using fundamental web technologies, demonstrating the power of a pure frontend stack:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> For the structure and content of the pages.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> For all styling, layout, and responsive design.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> For all the dynamic and interactive features, including task management and saving data to the browser's local storage.</li>
        </ul>
